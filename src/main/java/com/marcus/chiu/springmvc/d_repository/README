1. What is the difference between Hibernate and JPA?

JPA - Java Persistence API is a Java specification for accessing, persisting,
      nd managing data Java class/objects and relational database
    - only specification, no implementation
    - JPA is similar to this interface
        public interface JPA {

            public void insert(Object obj);

            public void update(Object obj);

            public void delete(Object obj);

            public Object select();

        }
      here this lacks implementations, and a JPA provider is needed

      if JPA is 'represented' as interface Hibernate 'represents' a class
      public class Hibernate implements JPA {

          public void insert(Object obj) {
             //Persistence code
          }

          public void update(Object obj) {
             //Persistence code

          }

          public void delete(Object obj) {
            //Persistence code

          }

          public Object select() {
              //Persistence code
          }

          public Object superSelect(){
              //Persistence Code
          }
      }

2. Difference between Session.save(Object) and Session.persist(Object)

- persist() - Does not returns generated Id after saving. Its void return type.
            - session.persist() for a detached object will throw PersistentObjectException
              as it is not allowed.

- save() - Returns generated Id after saving. Its Serializable return type.
         - Saves the value to DB immediately and keeps track of the entity
           until the end of the session

- both persist() and save() :
         - Session.save() for a detached object will create a new row in the table.
         - Does not save the changes to the db outside of the transaction.
         - Assigns the generated id to the entity you are persisting

- better to use persist() than save()
